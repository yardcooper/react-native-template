## :star: Features

- Seamlessly integrated into the React Native CLI! :sparkles:
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- Always latest dependencies :raised_hands:

## :arrow_forward: Quick Start

```bash
react-native init MyApp --template typescript
```

## :question: FAQ

### What additional dependencies are included in this template?

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Type definitions for React & React Native](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)

This template always uses the latest versions of the dependencies at the time when the `react-native init` command is being executed. This means you don't have to worry about old versions.

Lots of :heart: and credits to the owners and maintainers of those packages.

### Does debugging work?

Yes it does. :tada:

### How to do type checking?

`npx tsc`
