# :space_invader: React Native Template TypeScript | Customized

> An extended Template based on the [clean and minimalist React Native template](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-template-typescript).

## :star: Base Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- Minimal additional dependencies

## :star: extended/customized Features

- extended ESLint & Prettier Configuration
- tbd.

## :arrow_forward: Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template https://gitlab.com/hybridheroes/opensource/react-native-template
```

## :warning: React Native CLI

This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use `npx`, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

If you tried the above and still get the react-native-template-react- native-template-typescript: Not found error, please try adding the `--ignore-existing` flag to [force npx to ignore](https://github.com/npm/npx#description) any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
